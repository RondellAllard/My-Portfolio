        <h2>The plan</h2>
        <p>This is day 2 of 100</p>
        <p>  The current goal is to be qualified to tutor HTML, CSS and Javascript on a few websites. I have found these sites can pay from $10 Us an hour all the way to over $50 US an hour. This would be very sufficient to me living in Trinidad and a great way to reach toward my final goal of being a full-stack software developer.</p>
        <p>To be sufficiently skilled do to this I have been advised that I need to have at least 100 hours of HTM & CSS under my belt and 300 hours of Javascript. Since I am currently home, I believe I can get this done in 40 days, studying 8 hours a day.</p>
        <p>This means i should be getting a decent income before my 100 days of coding has come. Wish me luck.</p>
        <p>FrontendMasters.com, a website I have always looked at from afar with their very structured and academic approach for CS and frontend development, now have a hand full of free courses. I'm looking at you Mr.Boxill and anyone else who may have an interest in this field.</p>
        <p>Also, I am looking to hit a mile stone of 300 hours studied before day 40. </p>
        <p class="countdown">6 of 300 hours</p>

        <h2>100 days of coding & Go!</h2>
        <p>Hey guys, it has been far too long. I haven't posted for about 2 months. Not good at all, right?</p>
        <p>Anyways, this is me getting back on the horse. Starting 100 days of coding today going in for 6 - 8 hours a day study time as well. I mean what else do I have to do? </p>
        <p>Only managed to get in 3 hours tonight, Seeing a bit of issues trying to design with solely float, would report to you guys when I am able to push through.</p>
        <p>I would like to take all my friends who pushed me to continue my journey, Riyadh.B, Elizabeth.K, Ronnell.C. Until tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>CSS is hell!</h2>
        <p>Nothing noteworthy to say from last night, except that CSS can be hell! After spending about 2 hours doing my best to create a hamburger drop-down menu from scratch, I started to run into some very strange behaviour while adding media queries to my hotel website.
        </p>
        <p>All in a good day of work I guess. Going to put in another 5 hours now. See you guys back at 2pmish.</p>

        <h2>New Focus</h2>
        <p>Change of focus for a slower more optimised gain of skill.</p><p>

I will be learning and master HTML and CSS 90% of the time until I feel very comfortable with it. I estimate this should be done by March 17th 2020.
</p><p>
I would be posting all of my projects from now on. Feel free to check <a href="Sratch/hotel_site.html">here</a> for what I currently have.

Thank you for your support. Until next time</p>

        <h2>Goal revised</h2>
        <p>I have revised my goal. I now plan to learn and well enough to do CSS and HTML well enough to develop sites. It is something that I have not practised enough when I started, though I do have a good understanding of it.</p>
        <p>Anyways, very tired at the moment. Until tomorrow guys.</p>

        <h2>Another day, Another 5 hours</h2>
        <p></p>
          Another long day. Today felt the least productive of all the others.
          Here is a recap.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent some time studying in the morning before I went to bed after
          some late night and early morning responsbilities. I didn't some
          practice on sololearner. That felt the most beneficial. In total that
          was probably on an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attempted to do a basic program, a simple todo list that runs in the
          console. I still have not completed it, but I gained some valuable
          lessons. During that session, I fell into a rabbit hole and was
          slightly distracted from my main task.
        </p>
        In conclusion, I can say this, stay on the planned path, do not stray
        for the sole purpose of novelty. You have your goals, do your best to
        stick to them, do not ver off your chosen path for too long. Sometimes
        you need to but make this time brief.
        <p>
          See you guys tomorrow. I also plan to update this blog visually by
          late Monday night. Thanks for reading my thoughts.

          Shout out to Vinod for the critical proofreading, I would work on my
          grammar.

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Resources online are far greater than you may think. You may want to
          get something, in my circumstance it was an easy way to make tables in
          HTML. I have been searching for months on ways to do this with
          Javascript, but all the ways seemed a bit to complex for the level I
          was at and didn't fully capture all the needs I had. Then I noticed
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was studying AJAX with a UDEMY course. I noticed that the
          presenter would often have websites for all sorts of interesting
          functions. This is when I realized that I was searching for what I
          wanted in too complex a process. I then immediately found what I
          needed for my website. A website to produce tables in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a way it was very much like the debugging solution, I came across
          yesterday. Look for the most simple.

        <h2>Falling Foward</h2>
        <p>
          Tonight was a long night. I am writing this entry at 4:45 am, just
          short 45 minutes or so left to study. It was a good first day of
          "falling forward". I call if this because I was barely able to
          concentrate for the last half of my study session as I have
          procrastinated till the last moments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have fully resigned myself to studying a minimum of 5 hours a day
          and 40 hours a week. If I fail at any point I will have to pay my
          friend an amount for each failure. This literal price has given me
          some of the inspiration that I have needed. And I am certain that I
          will regularly meet my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until next time, more than likely just later today. Cheers.

        <h2 class="mb-5">My first post</h2>
        <p>
          Hey guys. My name is Pierre Allard. I live in Trinidad and Tobago.
          This blog is a story of my journey to being a Software Engineer/ Web
          Developer. I am very early in my journey. It has been about 6 months
          or so since I have started some time in July 2019. I began with HTML
          and CSS, unfortunately I have only reached JavaScript and I am not
          very proficient. It has been a bit of a struggle and I have issues
          being discipline. I am however over coming this and putting in more
          hours than I used to, but it is still a minor issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, this is my very first post. I will be posting here daily for
          the better part. Feel free to email me at. [] if you would like to
          shoot me any advice, work on a project or anything relevant to
          development. Thanks for taking the time to read my blog. See you guys
          soon.
