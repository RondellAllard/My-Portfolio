        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Resources online are far greater than you may think. You may want to
          get something, in my circumstance it was an easy way to make tables in
          HTML. I have been searching for months on ways to do this with
          Javascript, but all the ways seemed a bit to complex for the level I
          was at and didn't fully capture all the needs I had. Then I noticed
          something.

        <p>
          While I was studying AJAX with a UDEMY course. I noticed that the
          presenter would often have websites for all sorts of interesting
          functions. This is when I realized that I was searching for what I
          wanted in too complex a process. I then immediately found what I
          needed for my website. A website to produce tables in HTML.

          In a way it was very much like the debugging solution, I came across
          yesterday. Look for the most simple.

        <h2>Falling Foward</h2>
        <p>
          Tonight was a long night. I am writing this entry at 4:45 am, just
          short 45 minutes or so left to study. It was a good first day of
          "falling forward". I call if this because I was barely able to
          concentrate for the last half of my study session as I have
          procrastinated till the last moments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have fully resigned myself to studying a minimum of 5 hours a day
          and 40 hours a week. If I fail at any point I will have to pay my
          friend an amount for each failure. This literal price has given me
          some of the inspiration that I have needed. And I am certain that I
          will regularly meet my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until next time, more than likely just later today. Cheers.

          Hey guys. My name is Pierre Allard. I live in Trinidad and Tobago.
          This blog is a story of my journey to being a Software Engineer/ Web
          Developer. I am very early in my journey. It has been about 6 months
          or so since I have started some time in July 2019. I began with HTML
          and CSS, unfortunately I have only reached JavaScript and I am not
          very proficient. It has been a bit of a struggle and I have issues
          being discipline. I am however over coming this and putting in more
          hours than I used to, but it is still a minor issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, this is my very first post. I will be posting here daily for
          the better part. Feel free to email me at. [] if you would like to
          shoot me any advice, work on a project or anything relevant to
          development. Thanks for taking the time to read my blog. See you guys
          soon.
