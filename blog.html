          Hey guys. My name is Pierre Allard. I live in Trinidad and Tobago.
          This blog is a story of my journey to being a Software Engineer/ Web
          Developer. I am very early in my journey. It has been about 6 months
          or so since I have started some time in July 2019. I began with HTML
          and CSS, unfortunately I have only reached JavaScript and I am not
          very proficient. It has been a bit of a struggle and I have issues
          being discipline. I am however over coming this and putting in more
          hours than I used to, but it is still a minor issues.
        </p>

          Anyway, this is my very first post. I will be posting here daily for
          the better part. Feel free to email me at. [] if you would like to
          shoot me any advice, work on a project or anything relevant to
          development. Thanks for taking the time to read my blog. See you guys
          soon.
